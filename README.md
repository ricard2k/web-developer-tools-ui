# Rick's web developer tools

This project is only a response to a need. To have in one place tools to test our applications. 

## Who am I? 

I'm a millenial working in big enterprises tech projects. I've started doing applications in clipper for friends when I have 13. And got my first opportunity in the enerprise because I had knowledge about how to access databases from Visual Basic when I was 16 (the minimun age to work at this time).
